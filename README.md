# Computer Network Project

This study includes a sample network plan which can be simulate. On the GNS3 simulator, I build the network that my lecturer want. Then I assigned correct IP Addresses and give them into the machines via terminal.

You can directly download the folder called "mert" and run into GNS3. Also you can find the IP Plannings from the .xlsx file.
